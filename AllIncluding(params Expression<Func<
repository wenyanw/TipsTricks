Hi dear friends,

I have ganerated a new Repository based on Scaffolding.It shows me a new method which is I can not understand the input parameters of it.The method is this for example :

public IQueryable<People> AllIncluding(params Expression<Func<People, object>>[] includeProperties)
        {
            IQueryable<People> query = context.People;
            foreach (var includeProperty in includeProperties) {
                query = query.Include(includeProperty);
            }
            return query;
        }
Can someone explain me please what is this exactly.I really need to know the usage and the meaning of the parameters.

Warm Regards

Ali

This method allows you to Eager Load the related Properties: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj574232.aspx

If you have a Blog Object that has a collection of Posts objects, you can load the Blog and the object by calling

var blog = _blogRepository.AllIncluding(blog => b.Posts);

The signature of this method also takes in an array of expressions, you can chain other collections as well.

For example: if your blog has a collection of Tags, and, you want to load the blog AND the posts AND the Tags

var blog = _blogRepository.AllIncluding(blog => b.Posts, b=>b.Tags);
