Three wins of DoD
Integration
• Bring your code together
• Make sure it compiles
• Version code as a unit
Quality
• Make sure code works
• Measure how well it’s been tested
• Know what’s been tested
Deployment
• Make sure you can verify your c

TFS Build Triggers

 Scheduled
 Runs automatically based on a schedule
 Continuous Build
 Each time someone checks in
 Gated Check-in
 Each time someone checks in
 No direct check-ins to version control
 Based off of a shelveset
