I set up a web service weeks ago, and today it didn't work, throw the error below:

error 0019: The EntityContainer name must be unique. An EntityContainer with the name 'MyAppEntities1' is already defined. ##.csdl(69,4) : 
error 0019: Each type name in a schema must be unique. Type name '' was already defined. ##.csdl(79,4) : 
error 0019: Each type name in a schema must be unique. Type name '' was already defined. ##.csdl(89,4) : 

The reason was other deveoloper set up another web site, and has MyAppEntities1.edmx too.
The solution is to rename the edmx file, EntityContainer, and update the connection string under app.Config and Web.Config.
